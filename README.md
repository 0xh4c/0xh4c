## About Me

I'm currently learning offensive security.

I'm not an expert yet, but I’m slowly building my understanding of how systems work — and how they can be broken.

This includes topics like malware, binary exploitation, reverse engineering, and embedded system security. I’m taking it one step at a time and focusing on learning by doing.

## My Goal

To build strong fundamentals, stay consistent, and become skilled in low-level security over time.

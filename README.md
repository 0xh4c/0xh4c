### 🧠 Who I Am

I'm a dedicated offensive security learner focused on understanding how systems fail — from firmware and bootloaders to memory corruption in userland applications.

Driven by curiosity and discipline, my mission is to study software and hardware at the lowest levels and develop a practical, offensive mindset grounded in technical depth.

---

### 🎯 Current Focus

- **Low-Level Programming**  
  Writing clean C, analyzing compiled output, studying memory layout, pointer arithmetic, and systems behavior.

- **Binary Exploitation**  
  Practicing stack overflows, heap exploitation, and return-oriented programming using vulnerable programs and real-world CVEs.

- **Reverse Engineering**  
  Dissecting binaries, understanding malware behavior, and breaking software protections through static and dynamic analysis.

- **Malware Development (For Research)**  
  Studying techniques used in loaders, droppers, crypters, and evasive payloads — not for harm, but to understand the offensive mindset and how to defend against it.

- **Hardware Hacking & Embedded Security**  
  Exploring device internals, firmware extraction, UART/SPI access, and analyzing embedded attack surfaces from an attacker’s perspective.

---

### 📚 Methodology

I believe in:

- **Depth-first learning** — mastering internals before automation  
- **Real-world labs over theory** — learning by breaking  
- **Minimal tooling, maximum understanding** — no black boxes  
- **Documentation as a weapon** — writing clean, sharable code and insights

---

### 🛠️ What I’m Building

- A personal arsenal of exploit scripts, malware PoCs, and firmware teardown reports (private & public)  
- A GitHub portfolio showcasing clean, well-documented low-level projects  
- A long-term knowledge base covering everything from syscall tracing to UART pinouts

---

### 🧭 Vision

My goal is to build offensive security skills strong enough to:

- Reverse any binary  
- Break insecure firmware  
- Evade most defenses  
- Understand systems like an architect — and dismantle them like an attacker

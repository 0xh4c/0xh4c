## About Me

I'm building my foundation in offensive security with a strong interest in low-level programming, malware development, and binary exploitation.

I spend my time learning how systems behave under the hood — how they're built, how they break, and how they can be analyzed or abused from an attacker's perspective.

I’m not trying to rush through tools or checklists. I’m focused on long-term depth, hands-on practice, and understanding what actually matters.

## Current Areas of Study

- Low-level software behavior and memory safety  
- Exploit development and vulnerability research  
- Malware techniques and evasion strategies  
- Reverse engineering and static/dynamic binary analysis  
- Embedded systems and firmware-level attack surfaces

## My Goal

To develop offensive capabilities grounded in real technical understanding — and grow into roles where I can build, break, and secure systems at their core.
